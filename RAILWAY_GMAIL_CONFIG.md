# 📧 URGENT: Railway Gmail SMTP Configuration

## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

Configure these environment variables in Railway Dashboard:

**Go to:** https://railway.app/dashboard → Your Project → Variables

## 📧 **Gmail SMTP Configuration**

### **Step 1: Remove Resend**
```
❌ DELETE this variable:
RESEND_API_KEY
```

### **Step 2: Add Gmail SMTP Variables**
```
✅ ADD these variables:

EMAIL_BACKEND=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=udohpeterbrown@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=fdac hcuq libc ctsb
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=udohpeterbrown@gmail.com
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** The `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD` above is your Gmail App Password (16 characters), NOT your regular Gmail password.

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If emails still don't work:**
1. **Check Railway logs** for SMTP connection errors
2. **Verify Gmail App Password** is exactly: `fdac hcuq libc ctsb`
3. **Confirm 2FA is enabled** on Gmail account
4. **Try regenerating** the Gmail App Password if needed

### **If redirect still goes to login:**
- This should be fixed with the code changes
- Check Railway logs for "Redirecting to verify_account page" message
