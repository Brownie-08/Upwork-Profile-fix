# üö® SECURITY NOTICE - CREDENTIALS EXPOSED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your API keys and credentials have been accidentally committed to git history. While they've been removed from the current files, they still exist in the git commit history.

### üìã **Compromised Credentials (Take Action)**

1. **Google Maps API Keys** - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Disable/regenerate the exposed API keys
   - Update Railway environment variables with new keys

2. **MTN Mobile Money API Keys** - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY
   - Contact MTN or regenerate API credentials in MTN developer portal
   - Update Railway environment variables with new keys

3. **ClickSend API Key** - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY
   - Go to [ClickSend Dashboard](https://dashboard.clicksend.com/)
   - Regenerate API key
   - Update Railway environment variables

4. **Gmail App Password** - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY
   - Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
   - Remove the old app password
   - Generate a new app password
   - Update Railway environment variables

### üõ°Ô∏è **How to Clean Git History (Optional but Recommended)**

If you want to completely remove credentials from git history:

```bash
# Install git-filter-repo if not already installed
pip install git-filter-repo

# Remove .env file from all history (DESTRUCTIVE - creates new git history)
git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths

# Force push the cleaned history (WARNING: This rewrites history)
git push origin --force --all
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This rewrites git history and may break other people's clones.

### ‚úÖ **Immediate Steps Taken**

- [x] Removed credentials from current .env file
- [x] Fixed STATIC_URL configuration issue
- [x] Created secure environment template
- [x] Updated deployment guide

### üîê **Next Steps**

1. **Rotate all compromised credentials** (listed above)
2. **Update Railway environment variables** with new credentials
3. **Never commit .env files again** (.env is already in .gitignore)
4. **Use Railway's environment variables** for all production credentials

### üì± **Railway Environment Variables to Update**

After rotating your credentials, update these in Railway dashboard:

```bash
# New Google Maps API Keys
Client_API_KEY=your-new-client-api-key
Server-Side_API_KEY=your-new-server-api-key

# New MTN Mobile Money Credentials
MOMO_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your-new-subscription-key
MOMO_API_USER_ID=your-new-user-id
MOMO_API_KEY=your-new-api-key

# New ClickSend Credentials
CLICKSEND_USERNAME=your-username
CLICKSEND_API_KEY=your-new-api-key

# New Email Credentials
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-new-app-password
```

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Best Practices Going Forward**

1. **Never commit credentials** to git
2. **Always use environment variables** for secrets
3. **Rotate credentials regularly**
4. **Use different credentials** for development and production
5. **Monitor your API usage** for unauthorized access

## üöÄ Current Status

‚úÖ Build error fixed (STATIC_URL slash issue)
‚úÖ Credentials sanitized in current files
‚è≥ **YOU NEED TO**: Rotate all credentials and update Railway environment variables
